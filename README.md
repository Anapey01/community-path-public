Community Path Project

A free EdTech guidance platform that helps students across Africa connect community challenges to meaningful academic pathways.






The Community Path Project is a web-based guidance platform designed to help African SHS graduates make informed academic decisions by linking community problems, personal interests, and academic eligibility.

The platform is free for users and focuses on clarity, accessibility, and real-world relevance.

🎯 Overview

Many students in Africa choose academic programmes without a clear understanding of how their education can contribute to solving real problems in their communities.

Community Path addresses this gap by providing structured guidance that helps users:

Reflect on issues affecting their communities

Understand how different academic pathways relate to those issues

Make realistic choices based on academic eligibility

The goal is to support purpose-driven education choices, not to replace formal admissions processes.
